This repository contains the code for a ROP compiler that uses pyvex to support multiple architectures.

Dependency list:
  pyvex
  archinfo
  cle (or pyelftools or radare2)
  z3 (with z3 python bindings)
  pwntools (to run the examples and tests)

Setup:

cle
  - https://github.com/angr/cle
pyelftools
  - https://github.com/eliben/pyelftools
  - FYI, the pyelftools package in pip repos is old
radare2
  - https://github.com/radare/radare2
z3

pwntools
  - Pwntools is a set of python libraries that ease the process of exploit development (process wrappers, gdb support, etc).
  - It's only needed to run the example scripts and test suite.  It's not used in the actual rop_compiler library.
  - It can be installed from: https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools
